# LJ Code 301 - Day 1
Today we are back at it again. It is stunning about how quickly newly learned skills can become rusty.
In class we learned about adding icons from icon libraries to html. also discussed SMACSS, which is about trying to keep css organized and legible. I need to read more on this because I don't really get the distinction between body and layout vs layout and module. I hope that this method will eventually help keep things organized but on first use the multiple sheets are a little bit ungainly.
I worked with David on the pairing, it went well enough. 
I feel like the work load is a lot to have a lab assignment, home assignment, reading and journal. FWIW
