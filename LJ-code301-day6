Today we were introduced to AJAX and JSON. Ajax is a way to update a webpage without the need to refresh the entire site. AJAX provides an improvement in the user experience in that users can interact with different parts of a website while the site is waiting to receive data back from a server. Without AJAx the site would have to wait until the data (scripts) have finished loading. Data can be stored in Java Script Object Notation, very similar to a object literal notation except that the data is wrapped in "s on each each side of the key value pair. ex {"car":"volvo", "color":"red"} . JSON data is not a object however, it is a string of text. This is because HTML runs through plain text. In order to send JSON data, it must be converted to a string using, .stringify. It can then be converted a javascript object using .parse.
