# LJ Code 301 - Day 8

Today I sat down and spent some time learning SQL on the SQLBolt site, which I surprisingly like much better than java script. With a little practice I think I could be comfortable doing basic querys to a database. The one thing I did not quite understand was how to correctly use the syntax for left and right joins, but I had to leave to go to work so I did't get to spend much time on that part.  I will practice more in the morning.
The whole connecting the sql database was kind of touch and go, conceptually its similar to connecting node, but following the code was tough. ouch
