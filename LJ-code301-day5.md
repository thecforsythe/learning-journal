# LJ Code 301 - Day 5
After a long stint of work yesterday, I was able to get my portfolio project hooked up to the constructor function that displays project data on the site. It was a good feeling, I needed that. I spent what remained of the night playing with text styles, something I really enjoy. On Friday the class followed along in a group project where we built a form that enters data into a constructor function. ...could be a good stretch goal to try and get something like that working on my site. We will see how much time I have over the weekend. Before attempting that I would prefer to get my site fully responsive and get some examples of other art projects I have done up onto the site. I think it would be a better idea to get a decent looking and useful site that other people can view, before spending a whole lot of time on just a small part of the site.
