# LJ Code 301 - Day 3
Was a bit burnt out in the evening so I did not work on my portfolio then. instead I got up early and worked then. Was relieved that the assignment was not very complex and was essentially recreating code from the lab on Wednesday. I was able to get my tabs showing their content correctly and then spent some time tweaking the animation of jquery and restructuring my site so that the social media links would not slideToggle when the hamburger button was clicked. Watched a video and read a bit about handlebars...I get the concept in theory, would it make automatically loading the objects into the portfolio project easier? we will see.
